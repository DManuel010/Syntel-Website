## Command Line
	
### Clone:
	1) Click on the green button that is labeled "Clone or Download" and copy the link shown.

	2) Open a terminal window or Git Bash window on your machine and "cd" to wherever you want this project to live.

	3) "git clone <link>"
		This will clone the project repository to your local machine.

	4) "cd Syntel-Website"
		You should now be in the parent project folder.

	NOTE:  This is a one-time setup.  Once you have the repo, you don't need to ever reclone it.

### Workflow:
	1) "git checkout master"
		This will put you on the 'master' branch of the repository.

	2) "git pull origin master"
		This will update your local repository with any of the changes made from others on the same project.

	3) Make changes to your local project repository (new folders, new files, edit files, delete files, etc.)

	4) "git commit -m 'Some type of description of your changes here.'"
		This will update your local repository's history with your current changes, always remember to add a commit message.

	5) "git push origin master"
		This will update the remote branch with your changes to be seen and pulled by everyone else on the project.

	NOTE:  As long as you are within the project repo and have already done Step 1 (checkout), then anytime you make changes you just have to repeat Steps 2 to 5.

### Pro Steps:
	cd <path to workspace>
	git clone <link to repo>
	cd Syntel-Website
	git checkout master
	git pull origin master
	// make some changes
	git commit -m "this is what I changed..."
